## Description

This website was made for people within the millennial age range and younger who are sick of social media and its negativity, advertisements, and annoyances. On this website, you are invited in with pictures of puppies, kittens, and memes so that even a bad day can be turned into a good day! The motivation behind this project was to build a social media site where people can go to feel better, not worse. We solidified a lot of our knowledge of the backend of coding as well as how it connects to the front end.

## Installation

By opening the terminal and installing npm with the add ons bcrypt, bulma, connect-sequelize-session, connect-sqlite3, dotenv, express, express-handlebars, express-session, multer, mysql2, and sequelize, this site can be run with the functionality as was intended.

## Usage

This website can be used to share posts on a social media platform where kitties and puppies rule the site. Regardless of the status of their day, there isn't a sane person on the planet who wouldn't enjoy a picture of a puppy or kitten to brighten their day. Posts can be made with either text or pictures and submitted to the dashboard for people to see. The typical and annoying advertisements and algorithms of normal social media sites won't be found here.
